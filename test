I appreciate the effort put into the confluence document. However, I noticed that it does not provide steps for what should be done next. In Mylt, the DataBase service request no longer has a form available. This change is why I raised a ticket. Previously, a form would appear, but it is no longer available after the recent updates, rendering the document outdated.
